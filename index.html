                        Before exploring here's a few things you should know about me: I was born and bred in the Big
                        Apple which has me at a default of falling asleep to cars and honking. <br> When I’m not hacking
                        away at my computer you’ll likely find me obsessing over puppies, practicing boxing combos,
                        hitting it up on the Tennis court with my sister or baking up a storm. <br>
                        Here’s a little guide around my site: Home will get you back to where you came from. Within
                        About Me is this awesome soliloquy. Moving on to Experiences you’ll find all my Computer science

                        related, including (but not limited to :)) travel, art, fashion design, and an awesome picture
                        of me- be sure to look out for the captions. The last stop is Contact information - which I
                        think I can leave to some self-interpretation…

                    <H3> Avagadro's Calculator</H3>
                    <h4>Date: 12-01-2020</h4>
                    <article>
                        This Java program allows a user to input a molecular formula and calculates the weight in grams of one mole of that molecule. 
                        A mole of a substance, also known as "Avagadro's Number", is defined as containing exactly 6.02×10<sup>23</sup> particles of that substance. 
                        Since an element's atomic weight is equal to the number of grams in one mole of that substance we can utilize the specific atomic weight of an element, multiplied by its coefficient (the amount of an element in one molecule) 
                        in order to determine the total mass which is equivelent to the grams per mole of that element. 
                        To accomplish this calculation I begin by parsing the 
                        user's input to determine each element and it's coefficient. Once we understand which element we are looking for, and the 
                        amount of that element we are able to search for the atomic weight in our psuedo periodic table of elements and
                        calculate the proper weight. <br><br>
                        This program uses various methods, some which are called within other 
                        methods, while others are only called in the main method. In this program I need to sort the data file provided in alphabetic order, this file includes 
                        atomic symbols and their corresponding atomic weights. I used the bubble sort method which although may not be the most 
                        efficient, was used for pedigogy reasons. I also use the binary search method to search for the Atomic symbol/weight pair. 
                        The actual calculation includes various if-else statements to find the exact element symbol and coefficient pair. 
                        <br><br>
                        A snippet of the logic used to parding and searching to complete the calculation:
                        If the character that was parsed is an uppercase 
                        letter then we know that we have a new Element and must check if there is another 
                        character after. then the method checks if this character is either a lower case letter, 
                        an upper case letter or a number. If this next charater is a lower
                        case letter then we know that atomic symbol is equal to the upper case letter and the 
                        lower case letter together. Now, if there is another character after this in the 
                        string, the program again checks if this is an Uppercase letter, or a number. If this is a digit 
                        we know that the previous atomic symbol has a coefficient. We must remain aware that this coefficient can be two digits long 
                        therefore we check yet the next character. If the next character is a digit then 
                        the coefficient is the integer value of the last two digits. 
                        If this character is not a digit or there is no other character in this string then 
                        the coefficient is the integer value of just the previous number. Sticking with the Upper+Lowercase 
                        scenario if there was no additional chracter after the second letter then the coefficient is 
                        automatically 1. Now, if the second character overall was not a lower case letter there are only two other 
                        options- it could either be another uppercase letter or a digit. If the second character is a digit we know
                        that foresure the first character is the atomic symbol and the second character is the coefficient or the first number
                        of the coefficient. If there is yet another character in this string and this next character is another digit, then we 
                        understand the coefficient to be the second and third numbers.
                        As each of these statement are satisfied the elements "jump" out of the
                        if statements with their coefficient and element symbol we use a binary search to find 
                        the proper element and return it's corresponding weight. As long as the element is found, its weight 
                        is returned, otherwise 0 is returned. We use the value of the atomic mass multiplied by the 
                        integer value of the coefficient, and add that to the running total of the mass. 
                        This total is accumulated as i increments and every character 
                        in the string is read and accounted for. The method finally returns 'total' to the
                        main. A message is printed which reads - for a certain molecular formula grams per
                        mole is the 'total'. The user is prompted again and the scanner waits for the user
                        to input another formula.

                            This Java program uses various data structures to arrange a family tree and answer questions regarding the lineage. 
                            Although using a binary tree is pretty obvious, in order to store the data according to how it was arranged I needed to 
                            use arrayList, array and map as well.
